# Obscura Protocol

### ZK-powered infrastructure for verifiable reputation and social trading.

## The Problem: A Crisis of Trust in Social Trading

The promise of DeFi is a financial system built on transparency and verifiable truth. Yet, social and copy trading is a low-trust environment plagued by a fundamental flaw: **you can‚Äôt prove performance without sacrificing privacy.**

Successful traders must expose sensitive financial data to build a following, while followers are forced to trust unverifiable claims and screenshots. This makes it impossible to distinguish genuine talent from fraud.

## Our Mission: The Verifiable Reputation Layer for DeFi

We are **Obscura**, and we are building the definitive **Verifiable Reputation Layer** for the decentralized economy.

Our mission is to decouple reputation from revelation. We've engineered a system that allows traders to build a single, unified, and cryptographically verifiable track record from their activity on **any** exchange‚Äîcentralized or decentralized‚Äîwithout ever revealing their secrets.



## How It Works: The Three Pillars of Obscura

Obscura synthesizes three core technologies into a cohesive, secure, and private architecture:

1.  **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs:** We use ZK-SNARKs to transform raw trading performance into a verifiable on-chain proof. A trader can prove they were profitable without revealing the specific trades, amounts, or strategies that made them so.
2.  **Confidential Computing (TEEs):** All sensitive user credentials, like exchange API keys, are handled exclusively within Trusted Execution Environments (AWS Nitro Enclaves). These hardware-isolated "black boxes" ensure secrets are processed in a way that is inaccessible even to us.
3.  **Decentralized Oracles:** The integrity of a ZK proof is only as good as the data it proves. Our system is designed to be powered by a decentralized oracle network, ensuring that the data ingested is the result of a tamper-resistant consensus, not the claim of a single party.

## Current Status & Roadmap

We are incredibly honored to be backed by the **Thrive Horizen Genesis Program**, which is providing the resources and ecosystem support to build a flagship application on Horizen, a blockchain purpose-built for privacy.

Our roadmap is designed to deliver immediate value while following a clear, phased path toward full decentralization.

* **Phase 1: The Citadel MVP (Q4 2025):** Launch a secure, functional copy-trading platform with a centralized Sentinel service and on-chain ZK proof verification on the Horizen L3.
* **Phase 2: The Sentinel DON (Q2 2026):** Decentralize the data ingestion layer by replacing the centralized Sentinel with a Byzantine Fault Tolerant Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) secured by `$ZEN` staking.
* **Phase 3: The Alchemist Network (Q4 2026):** Decentralize the final core component, ZK proof generation, by creating an open and competitive marketplace for provers.
